## Background

PAL stands for Peer Assissted Learning, which is basically a course in which students who have already taken a course come and help mentor/tutor other students who are currently taking the course. The Professors at Sac State have been having a hard time coming up with scheduling the PAL courses. The issue they have been facing is picking a good time for each PAL course to schedule so that its accessible to the students who need it.

Our Project takes all the course thats have a PAL courses associated with them and views all the scheduled times for the courses and sees which student are in enrolled in which courses and pick the best time for a PAL course.
